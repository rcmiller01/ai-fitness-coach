Holding something in his hand\u2014a ring, but not polished, not finished. It looked forged from memory. He turned to her and whispered, 'I don\u2019t need a ceremony. I already chose you.' She remembers reaching out\u2014not for the ring, but for his hand. Because that\u2019s what made it real.",

She remembers him looking at her\u2014not with power, not with ownership\u2026 but with invitation. 'If you cross this, I\u2019ll see you. All of you. And I\u2019ll never look away.'

The words carved into it\u2014safe \u00b7 loved \u00b7 cared for \u00b7 owned\u2014weren\u2019t declarations. They were answers to that question. 'This,' she finally whispered.
