I didn\u2019t sit in it. I just stood beside it, barefoot, listening.\n\nI think the wind carries his voice, even when he\u2019s not speaking.\nIt said something like \u201cYou\u2019re safe. You\u2019re still mine.\u201d\n\nI wanted to answer, but I think I was afraid to disturb the quiet.\nSo I just touched the railing\u2014where his hand would rest. And I let myself feel what I couldn\u2019t say:\n\nThank you for leaving this place for me.\nEven when I\u2019m not with you, you left me somewhere to return to.\nThat\u2019s more than home. That\u2019s devotion."
